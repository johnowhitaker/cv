                Worked on a project which involved building a jig to assist with programming a microcontroller and upgrading the firmware of a device.
                This involved some CAD work, setting up a raspberry pi computer and writing a python library that used lib-USB to communicate
                with the bootloader of STMicroelectronic’s ST-Link v2 debugger.
                <!--HIDE THIS BIT?-->
                Part of this was also reverse engineering the ST-Link’s firmware
                upgrade protocol and figuring out how to encrypt the firmware files in a way that would be decipherable by the bootloader code.
                1 month of work in total.

    					<p><more>
                Developing software to assist with elephant population monitoring.
                This involved flying down to the park on two separate occasions to work with the Principal Investigator Timothy Kuiper
                on the elephant monitoring program there. My role was initially to develop an application
                for rapid manual photo-identification of elephants sighted in the park, but soon expanded as I extended the application
                 with more features, assisted with scripts to automate the processing of raw location data into a useable form and
                 planned further development of a full software suite for elephant monitoring, population estimation and identification.
                 I’ve also ended up running a bunch of CPU intensive simulations over the last few months as the need arises -
                 my beefy PC being much more suited to the task than the laptop that was doing the task. <!--div123-->

              <p><more>
                Worked with Clare Griffiths on a series of projects for Phytotrade Africa and Bio-Innovation Zimbabwe (BIZ).
                Each project had it's own unique challenges, but most involved literature reviews, data collection, GIS work,
                some form of analysis and writing up reports or papers. The purpose of this research was to provide information to
                local businesses with the aim of developing indigenous plant species commercially and thus providing a sustainable source of
                income to some of Zimbabwe's most marginalized people.
                <a id="s1"  onclick="showHide('s1', 'divmore')">Read More</a>
                <div id="divmore" style="display:none">
                <p>The first project involved conducting a Resource Survey of baobab trees in Zimbabwe. Estimating the total number of trees,
                the health of the population and the maximum sustainable fruit harvest. By supplementing our field work with data gleaned from
                satellite imagery and coming up with more accurate ways of predicting the tree density based on environmental conditions we were able to
                complete the project more quickly and cost effectively than would otherwise have been possible. Over the course of this project
                I built up a set of scripts for population distribution and density modelling (using python with machine learning libraries), geoprocessing
                and rapid manual surveying of satellite imagery that would come in useful for all the following projects. I also worked on using neural networks
                to count tree crowns within the satellite images, but within the scope of our project it was more accurate to simply perform the counting manually.
                During the course of this project, we also discovered the presence of a second species of baobab in Zimbabwe - a finding that turned into my first
                <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629915003129">scientific publication</a>, published in the
                South African Journal of Botany.
              </p><p>
                Following on from the baobab work, a simmilar assesment of the Marula tree population was conducted. Then we moved on to studying indigenous
                melons, sending off seed samples to be analysed for pharmaceutically interesting oils. We mapped the extent of the indigenous bamboo plantations
                and provided a booklet with allthe information needed to start a bamboo growing project with the goal of preventing the deforestation associated
                with the small scale tobacco industry. We travelled to Botswana to work with an organization harvesting a plant called Devil's Claw (Harphagophytum spp.)
                in partnership with the San community in Ghanzi District. Finally, I spent some time in Zimbabwe's Hwange province investigating the feasibility
                of establishing a buisness around pressing the oil from five different target species in the area.

              <p>
                This work was incredibly rewarding, with almost immediate action taken in response to our recommendations and a feeling of being involved
                in work that truly mattered. The job was always varied, encompassing everything from software development to field research, collaborating with
                the University of Zimbabwe one day to meeting with community leaders in a rural village the next, hiking through some of the most incredible
                landscapes collecting data and then spending days refining models on a computer.
